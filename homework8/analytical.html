      This page presents an analysis of my final Google Analytics report using real user data from my portfolio site. I focused on the “User Acquisition” report for the period of March 15 to April 30, 2025. The report offers insights into traffic sources, user activity, and site engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
      The majority of users accessed the site through direct links, indicating they either typed the URL manually or followed a saved bookmark. A small number arrived via organic search, revealing an opportunity to improve my site’s SEO. Enhancing meta descriptions, refining keyword placement, and optimizing page titles could increase visibility in search engine results. 
      </p>
      <p>
      User engagement data shows that the average session duration was under one minute, with most visitors viewing only a single page. To improve retention, I plan to strengthen internal navigation—such as linking to project pages or a contact form—and enhance content readability. Incorporating interactive elements like animations, image galleries, or call-to-action buttons could also help keep users engaged for longer periods.
