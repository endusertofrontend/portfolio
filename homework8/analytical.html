        This page presents my final Google Analytics report analysis based on real user data collected from my portfolio site. I selected the “User Acquisition” report for the date range of March 15 to April 30, 2025. The data shows traffic sources, user behavior, and overall engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the report, most users arrived through direct links or typed the URL manually. A smaller percentage came from organic search, which highlights the need to improve SEO strategies like meta descriptions, keyword usage, and page titles to enhance visibility on search engines.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average session duration was under 1 minute, and most visitors left after viewing only one page. This indicates that I should add stronger internal navigation (such as links to projects or contact sections), improve page content readability, and consider including interactive elements like animations or image galleries to keep users engaged longer.
