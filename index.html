                <h2>Hello I'm Anibal Pablo</h2>
                <p>I am actively working toward becoming a web developer. Initially, I planned to focus solely on front-end development, but my interest quickly expanded to include back-end development as well. Now, I aspire to master both, along with general computer knowledge. I've set a four-year goal to learn as much as I can in this field. During the day, I work as a medical interpreter, but in the evenings, I dedicate my time to studying and improving my skills.  I enjoy taking online classes. They provide the flexibility I need to balance both work and learning. My journey began on January 16, 2024, with CNIT 131H: Introduction to HTML & CSS.</p>
                <p>As for general computer knowledge, I have been investing time in earning CompTIA certifications. I earned my A+ certification in September 2024. In January 2025 I earned my Network+ certification. Studying for both tests has taught me essential foundations of computer hardware, software, and networking. I plan to study and then take the Security+ exam this upcoming summer break. I am fortunate to be interning at Tech Exchange, where I am learning the basics of troubleshooting and computer repair. I am having so much fun learning everything about computers and web development. A quote I really like is,<br><br>“if you have enough time to fantasize about a beautiful ending, live beautifully until the end” by <i>Hideaki Sorachi</i>.</p>

            <dd>In the CNIT 133 class, I learned JavaScript and how to use it to create dynamic websites. I covered key concepts such as syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, DOM manipulation, and function calling, building a solid foundation in programming.</dd>

            <dd>This is a personal project. I am actively working on the website, so it looks a bit scarce at the moment. The purpose of the page is to explain medical conditions to Mam monolingual speakers. Because there is a low literacy rate in the community, I will upload audio recordings for every project.</dd>
