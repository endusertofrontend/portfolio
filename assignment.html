            <p>Homework 4 requires the use of work files hw4part1.html, hw4part2.html, and fairytale.html. Hw4part1.html has you rely on grid to modify the page. Hw4part2.html has you rely on flexbox to modify the page layout. Finally, fairytale.html has you work with column-count and column-rule. All three are methods for outlining a webpage. The combination of grid and flexbox is most useful. The use of column-count and column-rule is more of a case-by-case use. </p>

These were made with the help of <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. ARIA roles were also considered, but because the website was made using HTML, semantics, there was no need for ARIA roles for this webpage.  </p>

            <h3>View Assignment 7 - CCS3 Animation</h3>
            <p>For Assignment 7, Part 1, you are tasked with creating a CSS3 animation of a flying airplane using a .png of a plane. The page must include a centered and static heading for the company name and an animated banner reading “FLY WITH US, WE ARE SAFE” that enters the left and exits to the right and finishes in the center of the screen. The banner’s text is also animated. In Part 2, you are tasked with designing another webpage that includes a main heading, a subheading, and at least two paragraphs that wrap around a .png of a house. You need to rely on the shape-outside property to accomplish this assignment. You also need to use a container query to reduce the h2 size when its container is under 600px wide. </p>
            <p>The second page is for your Google Analytics Report analysis. You’ll download a meaningful Analytics report in PDF format (such as user acquisition or traffic behavior), upload it to your site, and write a professional analysis of at least 150 words. This analysis should explain what the report shows and suggest ways to improve your website based on the data. The page must also include a clearly worded hyperlink to your PDF report and follow good SEO practices introduced in Part 1.</p>

            <h3>View Assignment 8 - SEO Friednly</h3>
            <p>For this assignment, you're creating two new HTML pages: one for SEO Strategies and another for your Final Analytics Report. On the SEO Strategies page, you’ll list at least 10 researched keywords related to your website, explaining which tools you used (like Google Trends or Ubersuggest) and why each keyword is relevant. Then, you’ll apply these keywords across all five of your website’s pages (your original three plus the two new ones). Each page must include a unique meta description, a unique title tag, a heading that contains a keyword, and at least one meaningful hyperlink. You’ll also include one keyword-optimized image on any of your original pages and revise the written content across all pages to use keywords naturally without sounding spammy</p>
